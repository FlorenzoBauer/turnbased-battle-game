# Tech-Tamers
### Abstract:

It is a poke-mon style battle game. Choose from a pool of ten characters, using different attacks to best your enemy. See how many rounds you can go!

### Technologies Used

In order to get this site working, we used React, React Router, accessed data with Fetch API, and tested with Cypress. Made our backend with Knex, PostgreSQL, and PgAdmin4.

### Wins and Challenges:
- deploying a backend server && database was a very tedious doc driven production. Definitely was the hardest part about the entire project.
- Wins, making a very retro styled-game, and working in a game loop! Hard and definitely needs to be worked on to get the full experience, but being able to useReducer and get control of so much state in a react app was a huge win.
